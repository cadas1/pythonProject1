They are dropping like flies...as many predicted they would given their previous injury record.


We need to massively revamp our midfield in the summer. We cannot keep hold of injury prone players, and the players are ageing and have been working hard under extreme pressure for many years."

My eleven would be

Alisson
Trent, Matip, Virgil and The Greek Scouser
Fab
Hendo Ox
Mo Diogo Màne 

Usually so confident against Arsenal, but Bobby usually has a stormer against them! Think Tsimikas would be fine and worth considering even without Robbos injury. Only decision (assuming Henderson is back), would be that third slot in midfield. Tempted to give it to Thiago because he so patently needs rhythm, but I think the Ox might have that added motivation to pull something out."
